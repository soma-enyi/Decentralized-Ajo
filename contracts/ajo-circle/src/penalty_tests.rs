#![cfg(test)]

//! Tests for the penalty system in partial_withdraw().
//!
//! Issue #682 — The late fee logic involves complex math that is prone to errors.
//! These tests manipulate the ledger timestamp to simulate late contributions and
//! verify that the 10% penalty is calculated and deducted with perfect accuracy.
//!
//! Penalty formula (WITHDRAWAL_PENALTY_PERCENT = 10):
//!   net_contributed = total_contributed - total_withdrawn
//!   penalty         = net_contributed * 10 / 100
//!   refund          = net_contributed - penalty
